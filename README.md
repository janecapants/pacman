# PacMen Exercise
## This project shows an image of pacman moving across the screen.

## Description
### Click on the screen to get the pacman to start moving. Once it hits the right side of the screen the image turns around. If you click the screen repeatedly it will move faster and faster. The background is a pacman maze. The pacman will keep going back and forth on the page until you refresh the page.

## How to run it.
### You must download the zip file. Then open up the CSS, javascript, and html file last. 

## Furture Improvements
### I'd like to add a ghost that the pacman chases across the screen.
